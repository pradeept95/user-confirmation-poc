# Race Condition Fixes Summary

## Problems Fixed

### 1. **WebSocket Connection Race Conditions**

- **Problem**: Background tasks started immediately but WebSocket connection might not be established yet
- **Solution**: Added `websocket_ready` event in `SessionTask` that tasks wait for before starting
- **Implementation**: Tasks now wait for WebSocket connection with timeout before proceeding

### 2. **Premature Task Execution**

- **Problem**: Tasks would start sending messages before client was ready
- **Solution**: Implemented `wait_for_connection_and_start_task()` function that waits for WebSocket readiness
- **Implementation**: Added connection acknowledgment flow between client and server

### 3. **Aggressive Session Cleanup**

- **Problem**: Sessions were cleaned up too aggressively on WebSocket disconnect
- **Solution**: Added connection counting to track multiple connections per session
- **Implementation**: Only cleanup session when connection count reaches zero

### 4. **Message Delivery Reliability**

- **Problem**: Messages could fail to send due to timing issues
- **Solution**: Added timeout and retry logic for WebSocket message sending
- **Implementation**: Messages are saved to state even if sending fails, for replay on reconnection

### 5. **Thread Safety Issues**

- **Problem**: Multiple WebSocket operations could interfere with each other
- **Solution**: Added per-session connection locks
- **Implementation**: All WebSocket operations are now synchronized per session

## Key Changes Made

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Enhanced `SessionTask` Model (`models/types.py`)

```python
class SessionTask:
    def __init__(self):
        # ...existing fields...
        self.websocket_ready = asyncio.Event()  # Ensure WebSocket is connected
        self.task_started = asyncio.Event()     # Track if background task has started
        self.connection_count = 0               # Track reconnections
```

#### 2. Improved WebSocket Manager (`service/websocket_manager.py`)

- Added connection locks for thread safety
- Enhanced `send_json()` with timeout and retry logic
- Added `is_connected()` method to check connection status
- Improved connection state management

#### 3. Updated Main Application (`main.py`)

- Added `wait_for_connection_and_start_task()` function
- Enhanced WebSocket endpoint with proper connection counting
- Updated task functions to wait for WebSocket readiness
- Added timeout handling for confirmations and user input

### Frontend Changes (`frontend/src/App.jsx`)

#### 1. Connection Acknowledgment

- Added handling for `connection_ready` message
- Sends `connection_acknowledged` response to server

#### 2. Enhanced Error Handling

- Better WebSocket error handling
- Proper cleanup when starting new tasks
- Improved connection state management

#### 3. Message Format Compatibility

- Handle both old and new streaming message formats
- Enhanced state replay for different message types

## Connection Flow

### 1. Task Initialization

```
Client -> POST /start-task -> Server
Server -> Creates session, waits for WebSocket
Server -> Returns session_id
```

### 2. WebSocket Connection

```
Client -> WebSocket connection -> Server
Server -> Accepts connection, sends initial_state
Server -> Sends connection_ready message
Client -> Sends connection_acknowledged
Server -> Signals websocket_ready event
Server -> Starts background task
```

### 3. Task Execution

```
Background Task -> Waits for websocket_ready
Background Task -> Starts processing
Background Task -> Sends stream messages
Background Task -> Requests confirmations with timeout
Client -> Responds to confirmations
Background Task -> Continues or stops based on response
```

### 4. Session Cleanup

```
Client -> Disconnects WebSocket
Server -> Decrements connection_count
If connection_count <= 0:
    Server -> Cancels task
    Server -> Cleans up session
```

## Testing

Use the provided `test_race_conditions.py` script to verify:

1. Multiple WebSocket connections to same session
2. Connection timing (late WebSocket connection)
3. Session info accuracy
4. Message delivery reliability

## Benefits

1. **Reliability**: Tasks wait for proper WebSocket connection
2. **Robustness**: Handle connection failures and reconnections gracefully
3. **Thread Safety**: Proper synchronization prevents race conditions
4. **State Management**: Session state is preserved across reconnections
5. **Error Handling**: Timeouts and proper error propagation
6. **User Experience**: Seamless reconnection with state replay

## Usage

1. Start the FastAPI backend: `uvicorn main:app --reload`
2. Start the React frontend: `npm run dev`
3. Test the connection flow by starting tasks and refreshing the browser
4. Verify that state is preserved and no race conditions occur
