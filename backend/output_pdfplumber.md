RESUME AND SUMMARY OF DISCUSSION: This application has been submitted by the Oregon
Health & Science University (OHSU) on behalf of Dr. Laurence Trussel, to the funding announcement
RFA-NS-19-037: Research Program Award (R35). Dr. Trussel is a Professor of Otolaryngology and
Head and Neck Surgery in the School of Medicine at OHSU. The goal of this research is to further
study how neurons encode differing signals from a specific sensory response or memory, and how cells
and synapses are then optimized for translating these signals into behavior.
This is a truly exceptional applicant and the potential impact of the research is high; overall there is only
one negligible weakness noted. The PI has made major scientific contributions to the field, contributing
multiple high-profile papers in the past few years, and he has a solid plan for for continuing to move his
research forward. Dr. Trussel has an excellent track record of mentoring, including diverse trainees,
and his small lab shows his ongoing commitment to personally training his mentees. He also has an
outstanding history of service to the research community. The only negligible weakness noted is that
while the hypothesis proposing that nanodomain Ca2+ signaling between ER and plasma membrane
provides an alternative form of inhibition in neonatal brain, is innovative, there is a lack of detail in how
it might be approached. This minor concern was mitigated by the PI’s outstanding track record. Overall,
there was great enthusiasm for this exceptional R35 applicant and the ongoing impact of the proposed
research.
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurons encode a wide variety of signals, each with specific
relevance for translating a sensory response or memory into behavior. How are cells and synapses
optimized to meet these needs? Our work has used in vitro model systems to understand such
specializations of function at the level of the dendrite, the axon initial segment and the nerve terminal.
The lab's studies have stretched the classical views of neuronal function, for example by showing how
neurotransmitter receptors in the axon initial segment and in the nerve terminal have unique roles for
modifying axon and synaptic communication. In this proposal, we will turn to a new view of the role of
the axon. Beyond its function in the one-way transmission of spikes, we will examine how subthreshold
signals generated in the soma, the axon or the terminal spread along the axon in the forward and
reverse directions to modify the spike and its propagation. Additionally, we will examine how calcium
release mechanism modulate excitation in neonatal brain. Key to these aims will be the use of carefully
selected mouse lines that feature sparse fluorescent labeling of neurons with fluorophores that clearly
reveal each compartment of the neuron in living brain slices, from dendrite to nerve terminal. The
research should reveal new dimensions of signaling that operate in parallel with the action potential,
particularly in interneurons in neural microcircuits
PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will reveal novel ways in which neurons modify the
strength of their signaling along their axons and synapses. Electrophysiological and a variety of optical
imaging methods will be employed in mouse brain tissue. The results will be of relevance to the
development of neural circuits and to the sensitivity of the brain to neuromodulators and pharmaceutical
agents.
CRITIQUE 1
Overall Impact: An illumination of mechanisms and structural components by which neurons translate
a sensory response or memory into behavior is of outmost importance to the field of neuronal
Physiology. Within this context, this excellent proposal by Dr. Lawrence Trussel (an outstanding
investigator at the Oregon Hearing Research Center) aims to examine how subthreshold signals

TRUSSELL, L
generated in the soma, the axon or the synaptic terminal of small interneurons spread along the axon,
ultimately modifying the spike and its propagation. In addition, experiments are proposed to examine
how calcium release-based mechanisms modulate excitation in the neonatal brain, and to illuminate a
structural basis underlying such excitation. The PI is a leader in the field, and has made major scientific
contributions throughout his nearly 30 year-long career as an independent investigator.
Armed with mouse lines that sparsely express fluorophores in cerebellar interneurons (unipolar brush
cells; UBC), a thorough experimental plan is proposed to address four well-defined hypothesis, each
based on strong experimental data generated at the PI’s laboratory. Specifically, electrophysiological and
optical experiments are proposed to evaluate restricted distribution of kainate receptors at selected
segments of UBC axons (Hypothesis 1), to determine whether slow synaptic transmission mediates
signals that spread into the UBC axon to regulate spike propagation and synaptic strength (Hypothesis
2), to examine whether presynaptic ligand-gated channels mediate the retrograde spread of local
modulatory signals to other synapses contacting the same axon (Hypothesis 3); and to determine
whether nanodomain-scale Ca2+ signaling between ER and axolemma provides an alternative form of
synaptic inhibition in the neonatal brain (Hypothesis 4).
Major strengths of the application include the PI’s expertise and trajectory, the strong premise
supporting the mechanistic hypothesis stated, the availability of tools and animal models needed for the
execution of most experiments, and the likelihood that findings from those experiments will reveal how
subthreshold activity in the axonal arbor acts in concert with the spike and the synapse to refine
communication between neurons. The only noticeable weakness identified relates to the suitability of
the proposal for the R35 mechanism. It is mentioned that the award would allow the implementation of
molecular (i.e., RNAseq analysis) and ultrastructural (TEM and STED) methodologies in the PI’s
laboratory. However, the application falls short of proposing a detailed experimental plan that would
exploit such techniques to reveal both specific molecular components and the subcellular machinery
underlying the generation and regulation of millisecond-scale signals along axons of interneurons.
1. Significance:
Strengths
- By revealing novel ways in which neurons modify the strength of their signaling along their
axons and synapses, the proposal addresses a topic of major Significance to the field of
Neurophysiology.
- The research will explore new dimensions of signaling in axons that operate in parallel with the
action potential. Such signaling may prove particularly relevant to interneurons in neural
microcircuits.
Weaknesses
- The establishment of STED and RNAseq-based methods to further explore major questions in
the laboratory is mentioned as an important step that would be facilitated by R35 funding.
However, studies using RNAseq-based methods are not proposed. While some experiments
involving STED and TEM are mentioned under hypothesis 4, those are poorly described and
evidence of feasibility is not provided.
2. Investigator(s):
Strengths
- Scientific contributions: Throughout his entire career, the PI has consistently made sound
contributions to the field of Neurophysiology, including knowledge that allowed an understanding
of biophysical properties underlying the functionality of glutamate receptors. As a postdoc, he
showed that the AMPA subtype of glutamate receptors exhibit ultra-rapid desensitization, a
biophysical property that limits synaptic signaling (Neuron, 1989). As an independent investigator,
his Biophysical studies allowed the development of robust kinetic models that helped explain how
these receptors work, further revealing the unusual permeation properties of these receptors

TRUSSELL, L
(1992-1995). He also found that targets of the auditory nerve almost always expressed the AMPA
receptor GluR4, and that subtypes of potassium channels in many of these neurons were
optimized to take advantage of the rapid AMPA receptor kinetics, generate brief synaptic
responses to auditory nerve activity (1994-2001). Additional contributions include knowledge
relevant to plasticity and modulation in sensory systems (mainly auditory system).
- Scientific productivity: 89 manuscripts since 1985 (2.5/year average), 17 of which were
published in the last 5 years. Remarkable quality and impact of publications: 21 papers were
published in Neuron, 24 in J. of Neuroscience, 6 in Nature Neuroscience, and 1 in Nature. Most
of his publications feature a small number of authors. In the last 5 years, the PI published 11
primary papers (all as senior author) and 4 review articles.
- Awards: OHSU Award for Excellence in Graduate Teaching (2005, 2014); John A. Resko
Research and Mentorship Award, 2012
- Funding: R01 NS028901 has received continuous funding since 1991. Funds are available at
the PI’s lab until 2023 through R01 DC004450 (Trussell, PI; 09/01/1999- 08/31/2023).
- Mentoring: Previous: 10 predoc, 16 postdoc (since 1990). Current: 3 predoc, 3 postdoc.
- Diversity: Strong record that includes being an active member of the OHSU Association for
Visible Diversity in Science. Dr Trusell trained 5 students of color and one student with a
disability (hearing impairment). Using funds from a Fellowship he received jointly with a student,
he will be funding a speaker series featuring researchers of color. He also took a 6 month-long
course covering racism in the US.
- Service: Decades-long record of Service. Activities include serving as Chair of the NTRC Study
Section, the Hearing and Balance fellowship review panel of the NIDCD, and the Board of
Scientific Counselors of the NIDCD. Dr. Trussell also served as Associate, Reviewing, and
Senior Editor for the Journal of Neuroscience (9 years total), and reviewing editor for the Journal
of the Association for Research in Otolaryngology (4 years). He was a codirector of the CSHL
Ion Channels Course and has taught the Neural Systems and Behavior course at the Marine
Biological Laboratory. At OHSU, he has served on over 25 thesis committees and chaired
Admissions for the Neuroscience Graduate Program for 10 years. He is also Associate Director
of the Oregon Hearing Research Center.
Weaknesses
- None noted.
3. Innovation:
Strengths
- The unprecedented ability to record from nerve terminals while the entire unipolar brush cells is
intact will help uncover new principles of neural signaling by revealing what signals the nerve
terminals receive.
- As in prior work, the experimental design challenges dogmas in the field. This includes the long-
established control of excitability by Ca2+ signals arising from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),
which has mostly been described at time scales orders of magnitude larger than the millisecond
one characteristic of synaptic transmission.
Weaknesses
- A more detailed description of STED- and TEM-bases structural studies is missing. Such studies
would expand our understanding of the subcellular machinery underlying Ca2+-mediated control
of signals within axons.
- Overall, much of the research proposed represents an extension of prior findings in other
circuits (i.e.; the dorsal cochlear nucleus) to the cerebellum.
4. Approach:
Strengths

1 R35 NS116798-01 5 ZNS1 SRB-H (12)
TRUSSELL, L
- Strong preliminary data is presented, mainly from the PI’s laboratory, supporting the four working
hypothesis stated in the application.
- Strong premise: Using the UBC preparation, transmission to the axon terminal of postsynaptic
(dendritic) GPCR (G-protein coupled receptor)-mediated synaptic potentials was demonstrated.
- Mouse lines expressing fluorophores in mature cerebellar interneurons have been identified and
are currently available in the lab.
Weaknesses
- Published data from the laboratory suggested that ER cisterns in the somata of some interneurons
mediate communication with plasma membrane ion channels of sufficient speed to control spikes
on the millisecond time scale. Unfortunately, experiments aimed to identify and explore such
subcellular machinery are not well developed.
- Evidence of feasibility for TEM and STED experiments under Hypothesis 4 was not provided.
- There is no mention of alternative strategies, likely because of the strength of the preliminary
data.
5. Environment:
Strengths
- The environment at The Jungers Center at OHSU is excellent.
- Access to the Advanced Light Microscopy Core will facilitate fluorescence microscopic analysis
and ultrastructural studies.
Weaknesses
- None noted.

CRITIQUE 2
Overall Impact: This R35 proposal is from a well-established investigator with outstanding
accomplishments, especially how receptors in the axon initial segment and in the nerve terminal have
unique roles for modifying axon and synaptic communication. Using a presynaptic model system, the
calyx of Held synapse, a brainstem auditory relay, the investigator found 1) the exact level of
presynaptic resting membrane potential (RMP) can set the baseline parameters of exocytosis. Variation
in resting potential over small subthreshold ranges generated steady changes in presynaptic Ca2+ that
controlled vesicle release probability. It was then found by other labs that passively propagated EPSPs
employ this RMP-dependence of release probability to modulate the response to subsequent spikes.;

2. the resting potential of the nerve terminal is controlled by a wide constellation of ion channels; 3)
activation of presynaptic GABA/glycine receptors led to depolarization of the terminal, rather than
hyperpolarization, due to an elevated Cl- concentration specific to the nerve terminal. He proposes to
examine how subthreshold signals generated in the soma, the axon or the terminal spread along the
axon in the forward and reverse directions to modify the spike and its propagation. This is a fantastic
proposal.
1. Significance
Strengths
- Axons could transmit EPSPs, subthreshold depolarizing synaptic signals, to their nerve
terminals and that these subthreshold changes in the membrane potential of the terminal could
control the strength of exocytosis. This mechanism may be relevant to local axon collaterals and
to short-axon interneurons within microcircuits. Because the axon itself harbors neurotransmitter
receptors, activation of these receptors can affect spike threshold in the axon. The subthreshold
“analog signaling” is much less known than the “digital signaling” in the nervous system and is
an important mechanism for understanding brain function.
- The investigator established a system, the cerebella unipolar brush cells, which is amenable to
study the subthreshold signaling.
Weaknesses
- [Not Addressed by Reviewer]
2. Investigator(s)
Strengths
- The investigator has made a number of seminal and rigorous findings and is a leader in this
area.
- The investigator has been highly productive.
Weaknesses
- [Not Addressed by Reviewer]
3. Innovation
Strengths
- The role and mechanism of subthreshold signaling is relatively unknown.
Weaknesses
- [Not Addressed by Reviewer]
4. Approach
Strengths
- Hypothesis 1 will focus on the role of axonal KARs. Experiment 1 will be using granule neuron
axons and testing their excitability by local glutamate uncaging. Experiment 2 will activate KARs
in granule neurons by optogenetically exciting mossy fibers when AMPARs and NMDARs are
blocked. Spike threshold will be measured. These experiments are very straightforward.
- Using the UBCs, the investigator will test hypothesis 2: slow synaptic transmission mediates
signals that spread into the axon and regulate spike propagation and synaptic strength. This is
already supported by preliminary data, supporting the feasibility.
- The third hypothesis will test whether presynaptic ligand-gated channels mediate the retrograde
spread of local modulatory signals to other synapses along the same axon.
- The fourth hypothesis is SMOCs, small miniature outward currents, is an alternative form of
inhibition when fast inhibitory transmitters such as GABA are still excitatory. This is an appealing
hypothesis. Advanced imaging techniques will be used here.

CRITIQUE 3
Overall Impact: Today we understand a great deal about voltage and ligand-gated ion channels. The
biophysics literature is replete with descriptions of channels and their behavior studied in intricate detail.
What we don’t really know is how these channels are organized, localized, and regulated by neurons to
play their role in a circuit. Dr. Trusssell has a long, prolific career showing us with beautiful, well crafted
experiments how neurons often do surprising things with channels to accomplish their goals. This
proposal is to do more of the same. In one sense this is a strength of the proposal: a gifted
neuroscientist with a long track record of high impact findings wants to continue to do more of the
same. In a different sense it could be seen as a weakness because this proposal fails to make a clear
case as to why long term, stable support would make a difference, why it would empower totally new
approaches or high risk projects.
1. Significance
Strengths
- This is important work that has consistently changed the way in which we think neurons work. It
is innovative, not incremental, in nature.
- How channels are put to use by neurons in circuits is fundamental to how the brain works.
- The PI has a long track record of doing seminal experiments that change how we think about
channels and circuits, so in many ways the significance of the proposed work has to be
considered in the context of the impact of the PIs work. He produces paradigm shifts, not
incremental advances.
Weaknesses
- [Not Addressed by Reviewer]
2. Investigator(s)
Strengths

TRUSSELL, L
- Dr. Trussell has a long track record of doing great neuroscience and publishing in high impact
journals. There is no doubt this will continue.
- The PI has a solid track record of training students/postdocs who go on to successful faculty
positions.
- The work this group publishes is remarkably creative and almost always involves “out of the
box” thinking.
- The track record of this investigator is remarkable, he has been very productive, and
importantly, his work is the sort that leads the field. This long track record of high impact work is
a score driving issue.
Weaknesses
- [Not Addressed by Reviewer]
3. Innovation
Strengths
- The innovation in this proposal is largely conceptual. Dr. Trussell does pioneering work in
biophysics that inevitably change the way the field thinks about channels and circuits.
Weaknesses
- [Not Addressed by Reviewer]
4. Approach
Strengths
- The approaches are feasible, and ambitious.
- The work, and the analysis, is demanding and likely to provide new, important insights.
Weaknesses
- If there is a weakness to this proposal, it is that it fails to articulate how the extended time frame
of an R35 award would make it possible achieve large goals that cannot be accomplished
during the shorter time frames of the standard R01 mechanism.
5. Environment
Strengths
- The environment and surrounding colleagues is excellent, and well described in the facilities
section of the proposal.
Weaknesses
- [Not Addressed by Reviewer]
Protections for Human Subjects: Not Applicable (No Human Subjects)
Inclusion Plans: Not Applicable (No Human Subjects)
Vertebrate Animals: Acceptable
- The use of animals, and the justification for their use, is well described and appropriate.
- The number of mice per year is appropriate and justified for this kind of research.
Biohazards: Not Applicable
Resource Sharing Plans: The resource sharing plan is excellent and appropriate.
Authentication of Key Biological and/or Chemical Resources: The authentication plan is excellent.

CRITIQUE 4
Overall Impact: This is an excellent application from an accomplished senior investigator with long-
standing interest in synaptic physiology, particularly in the context of the auditory system. The
investigator has demonstrated a clear commitment to mentorship and service throughout his career and
many of his trainees have gone on to establish independent academic research programs at excellent
institutions. The investigator has a long track record of creativity and innovation and has made a
number of highly significant findings. The four broad goals of the research program are clearly
articulated, and the investigator includes a powerful combination of electrophysiological, 2-photon
imaging and genetic approaches to pursue important questions in synaptic physiology. In particular, the
investigator has established new preparations to allow his group to probe receptor mechanisms
underlying subthreshold signaling in axons, and how these signals modify spike propagation. The
proposed work promises to offer continued important and high impact insights in the field and is well-
suited to the R35 mechanism.
